## About

This application converts your Airtable tables to Swagger files which can then be used to consume the Airtable API directly from the Microsoft Power Platform.

## How to use this app

Start by visiting https://airtable.com/api in order to find your Airtable API URL. You will also need to provide your Airtable API key, which can be found in your account page (https://airtable.com/account)

Enter in the details above and click generate. The generated swagger file will be emailed to the email address you provided. You can then import this file into your Power Platform project as a "Custom Connector".
